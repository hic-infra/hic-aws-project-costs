# Experiment: HIC AWS Project Costs

Experimental repo for processing AWS project costs by tag, taking into account shared AWS accounts.

This may be added to https://github.com/hic-infra/hic-aws-costing-tools if it works, unless it's excessively complicated in which case this repo will be made public.
